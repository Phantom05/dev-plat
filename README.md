# Developement Platform
I have made the **build system** that NPM uses as a platform.


## Developement Structure List
+ ### [Gulp Platform][0]
[0]:https://github.com/Phantom05/dev-plat/tree/master/gulp

## Motivation
Every time I use it, it takes too long and I made it easy to download and use it immediately.

## Build status
Because you need to use NPM, you need Node js and you need to install npm.

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.
